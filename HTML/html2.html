    <div>The most successful family-based company is Uijeongbu 'Pyongyang Family House'. The taste of Pyongyang house
        opened in 1970 was rooted in three places in Seoul. The first daughter, Hong Soon Jae, opened in 1985, the
        'Fudong elementary school', the second daughter in Euljiro 'Eiji elementary school', and the third daughter in
        2006. Following his father, Hong Young Nam, Uijeongbu head office is now in charge of his older son.

        Interestingly, the three nursing homes in Seoul are Pyong Yang Office and independent stores. Only the
        mainstream is the same. The taste is roots in the Pyongyang costume, but they taste as they learn from each
        store. Store names are also different. Only Jamwon - dong operated by the third person used the name of the main
        house. So, there are many people who do not know the relationship with the brother 's house. So is it. It is
        interesting to note that there are two houses of the same taste in Pyongyang, which is commonly known as the
        Pyongyang Noodle House of Seoul.


        Fei-dong and Eiji are different from each other in Pyongyang.
        The photograph is water cold noodles of Eiji house.

        Located in Chungmuro, Fudong is located in the back of the Korean theater. If you look at your seat, you will be
        disadvantaged. It is located in the inner corner of Euljiro Lighting Market. The cold noodles of Seok - dong and
        Eugi are similar in shape and taste. It is characterized by sprinkling red pepper powder on the sliced
        ​​noodles, which are thin and tender on the mingling broth. Hanwoo sauce and mackerel boiled in water, boiled
        eggs and boiled eggs in the broth, sprinkle with green pepper powder. The broth is fresh and refreshing along
        with our main store. The feeling of cotton is a little rough and soft.

        The difference between the two houses is revealed in the side menu. There is a difference between what is called
        pork meat and pork meat, and what is called pork meat. The taste is cool and it feels a bit rough. There is
        another point. It sells dumplings in the farmhouse. Dumplings filled with flesh are not as thick as punchy ones.
        You can feel the smell of tofu and meat mixed with the soy sauce poured in half. It is good to fill the
        hollowness that is empty even if it eats cold noodles deliciously. Eiji is a good service for patrons. Half dish
        can be ordered, and if you ask for Kimchi soup, it will be served like a drink in a water cup. This Kimchri-guk
        water than the cotton water enhances the taste before eating cold noodles.</div>
