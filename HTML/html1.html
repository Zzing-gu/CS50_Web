                'Uraeok' is the oldest Pyongyang noodle house in Seoul. It opened in 1946 and it has already been 65 years. Jang Won-il, a latecomer of the 'Seorae Pavilion' who became the actual beginning of the South Korean cold noodle, brought the Pyongyang cold noodle technician to the restaurant. The fate of the displaced and their descendants is no different from that of the present.

                After his late Jang Won-il, his son, Jang Jin-gun, inherited his family business. He also helped to keep the old Korean people who dreamed of the globalization of Korean food, and set up branches in New York and Chicago. His main bishop is his wife and his second daughter, and Daechi-dong branch is owned by his eldest son.
                
                
                Warm brewed beef broth, side dishes, and side dishes, various citation received by Uraaok (right).
                
                Pyongyang cold noodles of Uraaok produce only pure noodles without dongchimi. The beef and buckwheat flavored with the beef are deeply flavored, and the flavor looks good. It uses boiled Korean beef fowl and beef cattle for about four or five hours.
                
                
                The smell of meat, meat, and buckwheat
                Pyongyang cold noodle.
                The cotton can be tasted with two kinds of traditional Pyongyang cold noodles, which are made of 100% buckwheat flour and starch slightly. Even if it is not a rough face, the surface of the flour is high in buckwheat content. If there is no starch powder, buckwheat does not have stickiness and is scattered well. It is a house that puts starch only enough to make the dough. Cold seaweed is not elastic enough, but hot seawater such as warm water is enough to unravel. But the feeling of being cramped and spreading is rather good.
                
                The name is slightly different according to the season. During the summer season, pickled cucumber and kimchi are added on top of the broth and the taste is crisp and crispy. On the warm side of hot soup, boiled eggs and boiled eggs are on the rise. Warm meat soup is full of fragrant sesame oil. Bibim cold noodles are also better than other Hamhung cold noodle restaurants. There are many people who can not evaluate the taste afterward. The value of a bowl of cold noodles is 11,000 won, and the face is 12,000 won. It is difficult to get expensive because it is expensive.
                
                Cold noodles are the most difficult food to make. The cotton should be cooked properly so that the tenacity and resilience should be alive, and the broth should be the liver. In that case, Uraaok is a home that has been recognized for its taste as 'the house to come again'. The long years that have continued without shaking are the days of the fever.
