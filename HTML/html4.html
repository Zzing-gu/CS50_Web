              <div >I did not know that I would talk about taxi drivers and cold noodles. Uchimdae is near the company and is a frequent noodle house. The history of UML begins in 1971. Kim In-joo, who died in 2005 due to lung cancer, named this house after the name of 'Ummildae' under the Pyongyang Peony Hill. Now, his son Kim Young-gil inherited his family business, and his younger brother Gangnam is operated by his younger brother.


                    Meat more mung beef.
                    
                    A glass of drink that matches cold noodles and mung bean.
                    
                    Echimi jujube taste like bones, radishes, pears, leeks and garlic. Freezing and freezing soup at -30 ° C is effective in defeating the heat. Cotton is mixed with buckwheat sweet potato starch at a ratio of 7: 3. The noodles taste good, but the meat and mung beef are also good. Mackuton in the Utilong area has more meat than mung bean. It is a more savory taste of mung bean than meat flavor. Without the host, it is pork oil, which adds to its savory flavor. It is hard to get well. Thinly sliced ​​and moist, the meat is wrapped in a pan on top of the meat. We call this taste "taste called shochu" with acquaintances.
                    
                    It seems to me that I have not seen it for many years. The taste of broth is bad. It is a desire that the change of taste does not change the taste of tradition, regardless of the ingredients or the taste of the hand.</div>
