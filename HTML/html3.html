        <div>If the white meat and the buckwheat raised to appear to be loose, and the sheen and irregularities put on it are the typical Pyongyang cold noodles, "cold noodles can be so pretty". Cold noodles in a brass bowl, rather than a light stainless steel bowl, are uncomfortable. It is the most beautiful of the shape of cold noodles seen so far by visual.


                Service breeding and Pyongyang cold noodles.
                
                Sheep is the second brand of Baekje ribs. Pyongyang cold noodles, Hanwoo suldong tang, and rib caviar are main dishes. There are several chain stores nationwide. In particular, Banyei-dong headquarters is located side-by-side with the walled ribs, so you can enjoy cold noodles and meat all at once.
                
                The cold noodles of the sheep were produced by Kim Tae-won, a chef called 'Pyongyang Noodle Souvenir'. In 1952, when she was 19 years old, she entered the noodle house and learned the first cold noodle. Kim is famous for 'noodle maker'. The cheongbyeon noodles made by Kim cheol-jang mix the dongchimi and the broth with the broth. It is difficult to maintain the flavor of Dongchimi, so it is different from houses that only produce meat with meat.
                
                
                
                We have 1L of Dongchimi soup mixed with 10L of broth, which is beef and pork spine, rosemary, licorice and ginger. It is good to eat good food, but the taste of soup is sweet and refreshing even if I only try it with taste. Dongchimi soup and meat broth are harmonious and clean. The white kimchi, the cucumber, and the kimono kimono, which are carefully put on the buckwheat sari, are put on the bowl. Noodles are a little more chic than Ura. The dough ratio of buckwheat and starch is 7: 3. There is also a noodle as well. 100% cotton buckwheat is 15,000 won. It is more expensive for the price of seeds in Gangnam than the price of Uraok in Euljiro whether the place is making a price. To help ease the burden of lighter wallets, the two noodles come out separately on the plate in a cold noodle service.</div>
